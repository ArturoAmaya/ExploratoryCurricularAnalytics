    Attempts to parse course name strings such as "MATH 10A/20A" into the course
    subject, which Curricular Analytics calls the prefix, and number.

    Returns a tuple of the prefix, number, and either L/X if the course is

    analysis section.

    This function is in its own file because parsing course names from academic
    plans is somewhat complicated.

    Splitting course names is also necessary to get the prerequisites for the
    course.
