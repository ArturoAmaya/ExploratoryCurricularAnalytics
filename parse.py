    Reads and parses the file at the given path as a CSV file.

    The CSV parser doesn't validate the CSV, so it's kind of dumb, but I don't
    think much cleverness is needed for parsing these fairly tame CSV files.
    There is support for quoted fields and rudimentary support for backslashes
    (they won't break, but they're currently not interpreted, so `\\"` remains
    in the field value).

    This function returns a list of records (rows), each containing the fields
    of the record. Quoted fields have their double quotes removed.

    Since I gitignored the CSV files, I'm using `not_found_msg` to give more
    helpful error messages in case someone running this code hasn't put the
    necessary CSV files in files/ folder.

    Set `strip` to true to remove whitespace padding from record fields.
